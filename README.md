# fastcopy

Just because I can...

There was a tweet recently (link here: https://twitter.com/go100and1/status/1429800152278081543) which mentioned a new faster way to copy ever since go 1.17. Me being the troll that I am, I figured I could create a simple package to make this easy for people to use.

You probably shouldn't use it... honestly it's probably a huge mistake. But, I felt like doing it, just to check it out.
